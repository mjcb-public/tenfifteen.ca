Are you looking to upgrade your existing Network Infrastructure or build a new one from scratch? We can help design it properly.

## Network Design ##

Your Network is the most important part of your Infrastructure, but can often be the most overlooked and neglected part of it. A properly designed, maintained and supported Network is one of the best ways to ensure that your Staff are able to work without issues.

Don't let your Network Design be an afterthought, if it is designed properly from the start it will be able to support your Business and Staff for years. Your Network should "just work" and you should never worry if it is causing your Business any issues.

## Network Design Services ##

Whether you are designing a Network for a Small Business, opening a brand new Office, making additions in your Datacenter or just want to start fresh, Ten Fifteen Solutions can help design your Network properly from the start.

### Network Standards ###

Following strict Network Standards will keep your Network running smoothly. By designing your Network properly from the start, you won't have any issues in the future when an improperly configured Network Protocol or Feature stops working correctly and needs to be fixed.

### Scalable Networking ###

Designing your Network for how your environment behaves today is not the best solution, no matter how big or small your business is. Every Network needs the ability to scale and grow over time and by not factoring in growth, you risk expensive issues to deal with over time.

### Easy to Manage and Monitor ###

By designing your Network with consistency and standards in mind, managing and monitoring your Network will be easy to do from the start. We will never use undocumented features or hacks to setup your Network, so there will never be any questions on how things work.
