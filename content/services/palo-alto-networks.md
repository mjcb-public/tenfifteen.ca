Are you looking to implement a Palo Alto Networks solution?

## Advanced Next-Generation Firewall

Palo Alto Next-Generation Firewalls classifies all traffic, including encrypted traffic, based on the application, application function, user and content. With Palo Alto Firewalls, you can create comprehensive and precise security policies, resulting in safe usage of applications on your Network. This lets only authorized users run sanctioned applications, greatly reducing the surface area of cyber attacks across the organization.

Palo Alto Firewalls combine advanced functionality that are updated constantly by Palo Alto Networks to keep your Network protected from existing and emerging threats.

## Palo Alto Networks Features

Palo Alto Firewalls utilize an assortment of advanced features to protect your Network and Users from new and emerging threats, and provide superior management and monitoring solutions for your Administrators.

### App-ID

App-ID enables you to get visibility on the applications that are running on your Network, how they work, how they behave, and the risk of using them. App-ID uses multiple identification techniques to identity the applications that are traversing your Network, even when those applications are configured in a non-standard way. Palo Alto Networks updates App-ID definitions constantly, so you will always be able to identify your applications, and you can create custom App-IDs if you need to.

### User-ID

User-ID allows you to get full visibility on what your users are doing on the Network. With User-ID, you can create custom policies to allow only certain users to access certain resources, regardless of what device they are using to access your Network. You can align application usage with business requirements and, if appropriate, inform users that they are in violation of policy, or even block their application usage outright if needed.

### Content-ID

Content-ID is Palo Alto's single-pass architecture, which scans all traffic going in and out of your Network. It is a unique combination of software and hardware that was designed from the ground up to integrate multiple threat prevention technologies (IPS, anti-malware, URL filtering, etc.) into a single stream-based approach that simplifies management, streamlines processing, and maximizes performance.

### WildFire

WildFire is Palo Alto Networks advanced cloud-based malware analysis and detection engine. It has been designed to detect, analyze, stop and report zero-day malware and vulnerabilities and is updated every 5 minutes by Palo Alto to protect your Network as new threats emerge. WildFire is also used to power the Traps Endpoint Protection product that you can use on your corporate workstations and laptops.

### ACC

The Application Command Center (ACC) feature shows you a real-time interactive, detailed and graphical view of the current status of your Network. You can easily see what applications are using the most traffic, who is using the most traffic and where your traffic is coming from and going to. ACC makes it easy to get a high-level overview of your Network, and makes it easy to drill down to individual log entries to see exactly what is happening.

### Panorama

Panorama is Palo Alto Networks advanced configuration and management tool, that manages every aspect of your Palo Alto appliances. With Panorama, you can easily create and update Security Policies, deploy Software Updates and manage all Palo Alto appliances across your entire Network from one console. Through the use of the Panorama Logging functionality and the Application Command Center, you can see all traffic on your Network in one place.

## GlobalProtect VPN

GlobalProtect is Palo Alto Networks' secure VPN solution for end-users. The modern mobile workforce requires flexibility with connectivity options to securely communicate with work resources. GlobalProtect allows Administrators to apply the same security policies to mobile users as with internal users, with internal VPN connectivity and native 2-Factor Authentication. Palo Alto Networks offers many connection options for whatever Operating System/platform your Network uses:

- Microsoft Windows (UWP & x86 Apps)
- macOS
- Linux (PAN-OS 8.1 and above)
- iOS, Android and Chrome OS
- Clientless VPN
- GlobalProtect Logo

## Panorama

Panorama network security management simplifies management tasks while delivering comprehensive controls and deep visibility into network-wide traffic and security threats.

### Enhanced Management

With Panorama you can control your Palo Alto Firewalls at your internet edge, in your datacenter, and in your private and public cloud deployment, all from a single console. You can deploy Panorama via virtual or physical appliances, or both, and use appliances as management units or log collectors in hierarchical deployment options.

### Security Policy Enforcement

Panorama manages rules and dynamic security updates, so you can keep up with ever-evolving network threats. With a single rule base for firewall, threat prevention, URL filtering, application awareness, user identification, file blocking and data filtering, you can reduce administrator workloads and improve your overall security posture.

## Better Insight

An automated correlation engine cuts through the data clutter, identifying compromised hosts and surfacing malicious behavior that would otherwise be buried in information noise. Our fully customizable Application Command Center, or ACC, provides comprehensive, correlated insight into current and historical network and threat data.

## Advanced Firewall and Routing Features

Aside from the advanced Firewall features that Palo Alto Networks offers (App-ID, User-ID, WildFire), the Firewalls also offer all of the features that you would expect from any Next-Generation Firewall:

- Routing Protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP, Static)
- High Availability
- Interoperability
- Site-to-Site IPSec VPN
- Native IPv6 Support
- Virtual System Support

## Migrate to Palo Alto Networks

Migrating from your existing firewall to Palo Alto is not as daunting as you would expect. Palo Alto has worked for years to make it easy for you to move from your existing Firewall to their platform. Easily move from your existing Cisco, Check Point, Fortinet, McAfee and Juniper firewalls using the Palo Alto Migration Tool, which will attempt to convert your existing firewall rules into proper Security Rules that you can import into your Palo Alto Firewall.

Once migrated to the Palo Alto platform, you will be able to leverage the advanced capabilities that a Next-Generation Firewall can offer and get better visibility into your Network and your Users.
